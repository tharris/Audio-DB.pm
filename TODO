clean up so that

1) data access methods are in one location if possible
 or are in specific packages if they collide

2) none of the main modules should either
   1.  need to be passed the adaptor
   2.  need to be an @ISA of mp3::db::web

(should stash the adaptor in each object???)

3)  remove duplicated queries in the dbi::mysql

4)  rewrite reports to match the new strcuture (ie using returned objects instead of just lists...)




DB.pm is the sole new constructor factory for all objects


5) URL formation should be passed the object instead of having the object method passed to it.
